    "My project is intended to expand on the functionality of A3- Chatbots using the nltk module. While reading more about NLTK, I found nltk.chat.util, which helps organize the coded questions easier, and make the keywords easier to use. I used inputs from the source code of the chat object, which can be found here https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/chat/util.html. The object works with the key-value pairs in the 'pairs' tuple, which includes  \n",
    "\n",
    "I planned to include a sentiment analysis with the \"How's your day\" question from the bot, and for it to respond accordingly. However, I could not find a way to input it in the code without pasting the entire NLTK chat source code and adding it in the middle. Hence, I added it as a separate part, hopefully I can find a better way to incorporate it into the bot. This section of the code works by checking the value of the compound sentiment found by the NLTK Vader sentiment analysis, and giving different responses based on its value."
